                Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician who had a great influence on mathematics,
                computer science, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and theoretical biology. He is known to
                be the father of theoretical computer science. His papers are known as the foundation of 
                Artificial Intelligence. His work on breaking the Enigma code used by Nazis for radio 
                communications was crucial to the Allies and ending the war.
